        <h3>Summary of The Plague by Albert Camus</h3>
        <p>This book is about an epidemic that hit the town of Oran. This chronicle details certain key phases, such as lots of rats dying, the first human 
            death, multiple human deaths, when it is declared as an epidemic, the waning of the epidemic, and the end of the epidemic. This book is written 
            from the perspective of a narrator that tries to remain unbiased town throughout the different phases. Albert Camus had never lived through an epidemic
            or pandemic, so he used books and other reference materials on previous epidemic and widespread diseases to write this book.
