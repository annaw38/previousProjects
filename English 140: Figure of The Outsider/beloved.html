        <h3>Summary of Beloved by Toni Morrison</h3>
        <p>Beloved is written about an escaped slave, Sethe, lives in a 
            house that is haunted by a spirit or ghost with the rest of her family. The ghost or reincarnation of her desceased daughter
            comes back to exact her revenge on her mother Sethe. This book is written from multiple perspectives and includes several flashbacks. 
            This book is written based on Margaret Garner's true story of an escaped slave that killed her child because she 
            didn't want her to be a slave.
