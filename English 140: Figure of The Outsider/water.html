        <h3>Summary of This is Water by David Foster Wallace</h3>
        <p>This is a commencement speech David Foster Wallace gave at at Kenyon College in 2005. He talks about how ordinary
            everyday mundane tasks for one person could be a life changing situation for another. Therefore, he asserts that 
            we should be more aware of the situations we are in and think about our actions and thoughts to everyday tasks.
