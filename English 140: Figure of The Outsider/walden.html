        <h3>Summary of Walden (Economy) and Where I Lived, and What I Lived For by Henry David Thoreau</h3>
        <p>This book is an autobiography Thoreau published in 1854 about his experiment where he went into the woods to live in solitude for two years
            and his experiences of it. In the chapter "Economy," he describes the cost of his house, how much money he spent, and talks about 
            the cost of items in terms of labor. In the chapter "Where I Lived, and What I Lived For," Thoreau describes the places he lived and his thought process behind
            to go into the woods. His thought process mainly is to live and be free and uncommitted.
