        <h3>Summary of Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote by Jorge Luis Borges</h3>
        <p>This book is about Pierre Menard who claims that he wrote a few chapters of a book, which happens to be 
            Don Quixote by Miguel Cervantes verbatim. Menard took time to prepare himself to write his book by taking steps 
            like learning Spanish and forgetting the history from when Cervantes was writing the novel (1602) and when he was
            writing the novel (1918).
