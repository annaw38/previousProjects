        <h3>Summary of Funes, the Memorious by Jorge Luis Borges</h3>
        <p>This book is about a teenage boy who sustained a head injury, so he remembers everything. He thinks that a dog in one neighbor's yard from the front
            is different from the same dog but from the back. He remembers everything that happened every second of the day that he is unable to sleep because 
            of it.
