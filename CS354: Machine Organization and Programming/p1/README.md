Compile and run a program that has been provided for you to decode a mystery message that was encoded specifically for you. 
The original plaintext is a fortune cookie message which has been encoded by a backward shift of all characters by some number.
The exact number of shifts to encode your fortune cookie is determined by some computation on your CS login username.
