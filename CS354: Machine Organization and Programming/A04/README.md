Pre-conditions: needs n, x0, m, and c as parameters n nonzero positive number of values in the sequence,
x0 the first value in the sequence, m the multiplier of the previous term in the sequence, c added to the (m*previous) term,
print the sequence and return 0 if everything worked as intended, otherwise exit(1).
