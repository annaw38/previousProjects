# Homeworks for CS540: Introduction to AI

## Homework 2:
Given a shreaded piece of paper and the counts of each letters, this program estimates if the letter was written in English or Spanish. 

## Homework 3: 
Explore Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and the related python packages (numpy, scipy, and
matplotlib) through implementing a facial analysis program.

## Homework 4:
This program performs hierarchical clustering on socioeconomic data from various countries. Each country is
defined by a row in the data set. After each country is represented by its feature vector (x1, . . . , x9), hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) will be applied. This clustering approach will allow visualization of countries with similar socioeconomic conditions.

# Homework 5:
This program performs linear regression on days Lake Mendota is covered by ice. 
Input should be of the form:  python3 hw5.py filename.csv learning_rate iterations. 
1. the name of the csv file to read (e.g. ice_data.csv)
2. the learning rate for gradient descent (e.g. 0.01)
3. the number of iterations to run gradient descent for (e.g. 100)

# Homework 6: 
This program implements and trains a basic neural network using PyTorch. 

# Homework 7:
This program implements and trains LeNet, a simple convolutional neural network (CNN).

# Homework 8:
This program solves invariants of the 8 tile puzzle, in particular, an x-tile puzzle has x
tiles labeled 1 through x and 9-x empty grids, where x is an integer between 1 and 8. The goal is to
rearrange the tiles so that they are in order and the empty places are at the bottom right.

# Homework 9
This program is an AI game player for the game Teeko.
