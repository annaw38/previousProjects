# Weekly Assignments and Projects for CS400: Programming III

## Movie Timer App 
This app finds the shortest duration movie and movies between a specific interval inputted by the user. This app utilizes a 
Red-Black Tree data structure to organize the movies based on the duration of the movie and the movie's title. The data is
loaded from a local file that the user specifies. 

## UW Path Finder App 
This app enables users to find the shortest path (shortest walking time) between two buildings on the UW campus. The app utilizes
Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the connections in a graph that contains buildings on (and close to) campus 
as the notes, and walking paths between neighboring buildings as edges. The data is loaded from a local file that the user 
specifies.
